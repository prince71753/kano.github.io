        <h1> Tips and Tricks </h1>
        <ul>
            <li> ALWAYS be mindful of energy levels once you use q</li>

            <li> ALWAYS auto to proc your passive after hitting an ability. The majority of Akali's damage comes from her passive so be sure to ultilise it</li>

            <li> When using different runes remeber to alter your build. For example: </li>
            <li> Conqueror= AD/Bruiser items</li>

            <li> Be Akali. Be unpredictable. When in shroud run around your target. Keep them guessing then duck out of sight. Be the obscure.</li>

            <li> She is usually played in the top or mid lane with mid being her main role</li>

            <li>The majority of Akali's matchups are skill but champions like Master Yi and Renekton counter her</li>
            <li>Akali has been deemed a "problematic" champion and therefore receives an immense amount of changes often so she isn't an ideal champion to main simply due to the inconsistencies</li>

        </ul>

        <h1> Akali's Matchups </h1>
        <ol>


            <li> Range Poke Champions</li>
            <p> Examples: Tristanna, Lux, Brand</p>
            <p class="p"> ~Akali can and will struggle if the opposing player is good due to the range disadvantage. However, this type of matchup will be her most common midlane. It will be easy to carry out your God-given duties as the Rouge Assassin by going Doran's Shield, dodging, and freezing wave in front of your turret. Trade carefully!</p>

            <li> Antimages</li>
            <p> Examples: Kassidan, Galio, Dr.Mundo</p>
            <p class="p"> ~Welp you have reached the end. I shall press "f" and pay my respects:ffffffffff. Okay so it might not be 100% impossible but it's pretty d*mn close, so start clenching your butthole 'cuase it's about to be hell. EVERY MOVE COUNTS! Do not waste any abilities and DO NOT interact with your lane opponent. </p>

            <p class="p">Instead, be the Akali version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWSRBg1xo2I" target="_blank" class="c">"River Shen"</a>. Create leads in other lanes and help out your jungler &#40;in the rare case that you have one and not a baboon who escaped a zoo :&#41; &#41; instead of remaining in that God-forsaken lane. Switch with top if possible.</p>

            <li> Melee Assassins </li>
            <p> Examples: Zed, Katarina, Talon, Diana, Yasuo</p>
            <p class="p"> ~So here's the deal, you win some, you lose some. Yasuo, Kat, and Fizz, are beatable. They're some of the easier matchups however you get outscaled, so snowball as hard and fast as possible.</p>

            <p class="p">Talon, Zed and Diana are another type of monster. Riot &#40;who created the game, and consistantly gets sh*t for not knowing how to balance the game &#41; recently made them into junglers despite the fact that they were already hella strong so, GL! &#40;Same rules apply as antimages&#41; </p>

            <li> Bruisers &#40;except Tryndamere&#41;</li>
            <p> Examples: Renekton, Riven, Aatrox, Mordekaiser, Darius</p>
            <p class="p"> ~You lose. Bruisers are too tanky and deal too much damage so unless you can outplay and they mess up, you're probably going to lose. It's even worse since you're probably top when facing these champs and since the lane isn't in the best spot right now, you're kinda f*cked. Junglers neglect top so start digging your grave while you can. Oh, and take teleport, you'll need it.</p>

            <li>Tanks</li>
            <p> Examples: Ornn, Garen, Shen </p>
            <p class="p"> ~Much like Bruisers you'll have a hard time. However, you can beat tanks super early game like before 3rd back &#40;15-25 minutes&#41; they are killable early but after they get items it gets really hard because well they tank your damage. So take teleport to make an impact elsewhere in the game before you get outscaled</p>
