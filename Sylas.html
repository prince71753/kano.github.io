        <h1> Tips and Tricks </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't use your w right away in fights. It does more damage the lower health the opponent is and it heals you more based off of your missing health</li>

            <li> ALWAYS auto to proc your passive after hitting an ability. The majority of Sylas' damage comes from his passive so be sure to ultilise it. You get 3 charges of it but they only last 10 seconds so be sure not to let them go to waste</li>

            <li> My mans Sylas goes through his mana reserves like college students waste money, that's to say a lot. So watch your resource bar to ensure you have enough to stay in lane/finish your combo. </li>

            <li> Your base defensive stats are pretty low so avoid poke as much as possible. You don't have the armor or magic resistance needed to tank ability after ability.</li>

            <li> Sylas is pretty good early game by level 6, he really shines. At 6 he unlocks his ultimate which allows him to steal another champion's ultimate, so hitting 6 before your the other laner is important in order to maximise your ultimate </li>

            <li> He is usually played in the top or mid lane with mid being his main role</li>

            <li> Sylas can do well into champions like Akali and Katarina so when you see them lock him in if possible</li>

            <li>Sylas like Akali has been deemed a "problematic" champion and therefore receives an immense amount of changes often so he too isn't an ideal champion to main simply due to the inconsistencies. He used to be able to jungle but he can no longer do so</li>

        <h1> Sylas' Matchups </h1>
        <h3>He really only has 2 types of matchups: those he can win and those he cannot</h3>
        <ol>


            <li>Winnable</li>
            <p> Examples: Akali, Katarina, <a href="Lux.html" class="c">Lux</a>, Zillean, Corki</p>
            <p class="p"> ~He plays this like any other melee champion: Try not to get harrassed out of lane, roam to assert dominance on any fool dumb enough to allow Sylas pass the ban phase and scale up to 3 shot everyone who isn't a Tank or Bruiser</p>

            <li>Un-winnable</li>
            <p> Examples: Most toplaners &#40; Sion, Jayce, Darius,..maybe not Irelia&#41;</p>
            <p class="p"> ~Welp. You done f*cked up or you got counter picked. You're probably top so you better hope that the enemy is a compelete and utter idiot &#40;happens often so don't worry, unless you're in high elo then just go next &#41;. Take <a href="https://www.esportspedia.com/lol/Teleport" target="_blank" class="c">teleport</a> if you even want to play the match and do your best to scale and try to be <a href="https://aminoapps.com/c/anime/page/blog/reasons-why-sakura-is-a-useless-character-and-sucks/08tk_uKK6x7mGqzp1zq3vZoL8Mdrbq" target="_blank" class="c">more useful than Sakura from Naruto</a> :&#41;</p>
